# APP_BASE_URL: This is the base public URL where the service will be running.
#	- If Joplin Server needs to be accessible over the internet, configure APP_BASE_URL as follows: https://example.com/joplin. 
#	- If Joplin Server does not need to be accessible over the internet, set the the APP_BASE_URL to your server's hostname. 
#     For Example: http://[hostname]:22300. The base URL can include the port.
# APP_PORT: The local port on which the Docker container will listen. 
#	- This would typically be mapped to port to 443 (TLS) with a reverse proxy.
#	- If Joplin Server does not need to be accessible over the internet, the port can be mapped to 22300.
